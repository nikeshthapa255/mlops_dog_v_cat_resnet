### Project Idea
**Title**: **Image Classification API with Pre-trained ResNet Model**

**Objective**: Deploy a pre-trained ResNet model for image classification and serve predictions through a secure API endpoint.

**Project Overview**:
1. **Model**: Use a pre-trained ResNet model (e.g., ResNet50) available through PyTorch or TensorFlow for classifying images into predefined categories (e.g., animals, objects, scenes).
   
2. **API Server**: Implement the API server using **FastAPI**. The API will accept image uploads, preprocess the images, use the ResNet model to classify them, and return the predicted class.

3. **GitHub Actions**: Set up a workflow to run tests on the model and API server each time a change is pushed to the repository. This ensures continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD).

4. **Dockerization**: Create a Dockerfile that includes the API server, the necessary dependencies, and the pre-trained model. The Docker image will be built and stored on Docker Hub.

5. **Deployment**: Deploy the Docker container on an **AWS EC2** instance. Use an **API Gateway** to expose the API endpoint securely.

**GitHub Repository Name**: 
`image-classification-api`

### Steps to Implement:
1. **Model Preparation**:
   - Load the pre-trained ResNet model.
   - Create a function to preprocess input images and make predictions.

2. **API Server**:
   - Develop the API server using FastAPI.
   - Implement endpoints for uploading images and returning predictions.

3. **Testing & GitHub Actions**:
   - Write unit tests for the API and the model.
   - Configure GitHub Actions for continuous testing and deployment.

4. **Docker Setup**:
   - Write a Dockerfile for the project.
   - Build and push the Docker image to Docker Hub.

5. **AWS Deployment**:
   - Launch an EC2 instance, pull the Docker image, and run the container.
   - Set up an API Gateway to manage and secure the API endpoint.

This project idea encapsulates the entire ML deployment lifecycle, from model selection to cloud deployment, making it an excellent hands-on experience for end-to-end machine learning engineering.
